// Eloquent Javascript Chapter 13 Notes

// JavaScript and the Browser:

// JavaScript would not exist if not for the web browser. And modern web browsers would not exist if not for JavaScript. The two are tightly intertwined. Web technology has been descentralized from the start since various browser vendors have added new functionality in lopsided fashion.

// Networks and the Internet:

// The internet has a language that allows the transfer of bits through lines. This protocol allows for the guided transmission of data. The internet is a network of networks.

// HTTP is the protocol that web browsers use to request documents from servers. The browser sends a request to the server and the server sends a response back. The response is usually an HTML document.

// TCP/IP is the protocol that the internet uses to send data. It is a set of rules that allows computers to communicate with each other.

// The Web:

// The web is a way of sharing documents. It is a set of protocols that allows for the transfer of documents. The web is a network of documents that are linked together.

// A URL is a way of specifying the location of a document on the web. It is a string that specifies the protocol, the server, and the path to the document.

// HTML:

// HTML is a markup language that is used to create documents on the web. It is a way of specifying the structure of a document. HTML is a set of tags that are used to specify the structure of a document.

// HTML and JavaScript:

// the '<script>' tag is used to include JavaScript code in an HTML document. The '<script>' tag can be used to include JavaScript code in the head or body of an HTML document.

// In the Sandbox:

// Downloading and running applications from the internet has risks, but the browser bars JavaScript from doing things that don't immediately relate to the web page.

// When you isolate a programming environment it is called sandboxing. Browsers are able to run JavaScript in a sandboxed environment.

// This does not make the browser immune to security threats. It is still possible for a malicious website to exploit a vulnerability in the browser.

// Compatiblity and the Web Browser Wars:

// Mosaic was the first official web browser and it dominated the market for a while. Netscape Navigator was the first browser to support JavaScript. Microsoft created Internet Explorer and it became the dominant browser.

// The browser wars were a series of battles between Microsoft and Netscape. Microsoft won the browser wars and Internet Explorer became the dominant browser.

// Mozilla was created as an open source project to create a new browser. Mozilla eventually became Firefox.
